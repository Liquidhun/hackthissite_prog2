Hi,

this python3 code is to resolve HTS Programming miission 2 riddle. 
It is an interesting mission especcially if you're not familiar with image manipulation. 
Before clone and run:
- try to understand the problem to get able to solve it,
- pick any language
- learn image reading (pixel by pixel) 
- learn to get information from image (pixel RGB, position, etc)
- learn using Arrays (search in array)
- string operations

Here's the mission (have to solve mission 1 before):

Cheers.
